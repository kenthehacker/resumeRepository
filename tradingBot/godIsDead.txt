Hey folks! If you're reading this, it's basically an improptu README because IDK GitHub at all
So yeah the following is chronologically kinda how this code was made:


Part 1: Authentication 
This is the encoded URL for localhost
http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F
TD Ameritrade URL Authenticator:
https://auth.tdameritrade.com/auth?response_type=code&redirect_uri={URLENCODED REDIRECT URI}&client_id={URLENCODED Consumer Key}%40AMER.OAUTHAP
ohh look what do we know? they won't let us auto authenticate anymore because of some bs security
on top of their oAuth. I mean what can hackers do? ruin my life by buying 1000 puts on SPY expiring the next day?
So I only automated half of the authentication the only work i have to do is answer a security question
from reddit for the authorization_code:
    grant_type: authorization_code  (literally type "authorization_code" into the box without quotes)
    refresh_token: (leave blank - I know... none of the labeling makes sense, just trust me)
    acccess_type: offline (same as above, literally type "offline" into the box without quotes)
    code: decodedStuffFromStep18
    client_id: CONSUMERKEY@AMER.OAUTHAP (yes, add "@AMER.OAUTHAP" without quotes)
    redirect_uri: http://localhost
It pastes the oAuth Tokens into Key.py and a TXT file. Key.py pulls out the token from thin air and TXT files keep tracks of all the 
oAuth Tokens in case if something breaks regarding the authenticator and we can see what's going on



Part 2: Getting Price Information
Basically this is going to spit out all the data of a stonk. The Main.py is the brain where it will pass in 
price.py's Stonk class which passes in a stonk ticker and theres different methods that will extract diff Informatio
